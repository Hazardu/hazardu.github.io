    <h1>Art</h1>
    <p>I learned how to draw with the purpose of creating concept art for my game dev projects. Mainly drew depictions of fantasy characters and later environments. My favourite artist is WLOP.</p>
    <p>Here is a collection of my digital artworks created in Photoshop. Most photoshop files were lost during drive wipes when I needed more space for programming projects. However, I still want to showcase some finished pieces and WIPs I found.</p>
    <p>All the artworks are from 2017-2021.</p>

        <p>I put a little more effort into this one, as it was intended for a cover of a fantasy novel. Unfortunately, I lost the original psd file so this is the highest res I could find of this artwork.</p>
