        <h2>Welcome to Champions of The Forest</h2>
        <p>A mod that completely flips the genre of The Forest on its head.</p>
        <p>As a long time fan of action RPGs, I decided to transform this survival horror game into something very different. The original objective is to survive on an island full of cannibals and mutants. In my version? The enemies have to survive YOU.</p>
        <p>The mod implements all the typical ARPG systems: experience and leveling, skill trees, spells, boss fights, loot with stats, progressive difficulty, min-maxing builds. And yes, it all works in multiplayer—thanks to a surprisingly clever (and hacky) solution.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, my favorite game Diablo III was between seasons and I got bored of the endgame grind. So I decided to make my own game to play.</p>
        <p>Problem: making your own game from scratch on the scale of Diablo or Path of Exile is a massive time sink. And back in 2017, I was still pretty green at game development. At some point, self-teaching hits a wall—you reach that frustrating stage where you don't know what you don't know. YouTube tutorials can only get you so far.</p>
        <p>So I pivoted to modding instead. You get a solid base product to work with, it forces you to reverse engineer professional code (the best teacher), and there's a community full of smart modders to answer questions when you're stuck.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Players customize their builds by spending points on active abilities or passive perks, and equipping items they craft or loot from enemies.</p>
        <p>The host can choose from multiple difficulty stages. Each one ramps up the challenge with stronger enemies, but also rewards better loot and more exp.</p>
        <p>Classic RPG archetypes work here: melee, ranged, mage, support. Each has its own stat priorities, which makes trading equipment between players meaningful.</p>
        <p>Both players and enemies can cast spells with damage, buffs, and debuffs. Making this work required some serious surgery on the game's combat and AI logic. The original systems weren't built for taunts, stuns, knockbacks, slows, or poisons—so I had to rewrite the aggression and targeting systems to make enemies actually respond to these mechanics.</p>
        <p>I made sure there's enough build variety, player synergies, and strategies for early/mid/late game to keep things interesting. This mod genuinely brought back veteran players who'd given up on The Forest due to its lack of replayability and endgame challenge.</p>

        <h2>Starting with nothing</h2>
        <p>If you look closely, you might notice the visual effects and UI aren't exactly AAA quality.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of easy ways to make things in Unity look polished—better animations, particle systems, clever component usage, custom shaders, etc.</p>
        <p>Here's the catch: everything you see was made 100% in raw code. No exceptions.</p>
        <p>The main challenge of modding a Unity game was that my only tool injected code into game binaries. Zero access to the Unity Editor or any standard development tools.</p>
        <p>No drag-and-drop. No scene preview. No play-mode testing. Just code, compile, boot the game, and pray it doesn't crash.</p>
        <p>I had to build my own pipeline for everything. Loading .obj files into Unity meshes, parsing .png textures, importing .wav audio, even connecting to Google Drive to fetch patch notes. The shipped game didn't include any of these libraries, so I improvised. I also built custom dev tools: a perk tree visualizer that parsed .cs files, pre/post-build scripts, and a modified fork of ModAPI itself.</p>
        <p>Creating materials meant decompiling Unity's standard BSDF shader just to figure out which properties to assign. Spawning a GameObject with mesh, renderer, physics, animations, and custom scripts when an enemy dies and drops loot? Yep, all done in code. No editor. Just pure Unity API calls.</p>
        <p>The weirdest challenge? Multiplayer. The game used Bolt, which was 99% editor-configured. Its assembly was filled with obfuscated auto-generated classes that were nearly impossible to decompile or extend. THE SOLUTION: I hijacked the in-game chat. I created fake users with IDs that didn't match any real player (like user 420), so their messages wouldn't display for vanilla players. When I needed to sync an ability cast or VFX, I'd convert parameters—skill ID, position, rotation, damage—into bytes, then chars, then a string, and send it as a "chat message" from user 420. Players with the mod would intercept these messages, decode the parameters, and execute the corresponding function. Jank? Absolutely. Did it work? Perfectly. With generic types and abstraction it even looked good, and ran fast. </p>

        <h2>The worst parts</h2>
        <p>Every limitation I hit became a puzzle to solve. No editor? Write hundreds of lines of code to manually spawn meshes, materials, physics components, animations, and behavior scripts—then boot up the entire game just to see if it crashes or actually works.</p>
        <p>Want knockback? Dissect and rebuild the AI routines. Want synchronized spell effects? Essentially reimplement a networking layer from scratch using only what the game exposes through chat messages.</p>
        <p>It was frustrating and messy. But honestly? Incredibly educational. By the end, I wasn't just modding The Forest—I was effectively rewriting parts of its engine from the outside in.</p>

        <h2>Art and Design</h2>
        <p>Almost all visual assets were created by me using Blender and Photoshop. Only a couple of 3D weapon models came from free sites.</p>
        <p>I designed and implemented new UI layouts, icons, and VFX entirely in code. This deepened my understanding of rendering pipelines and Unity's internal shader model—I had to decompile shaders just to figure out what properties to set at runtime.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>For the amount of things I learned from this project, it was definitely worth spending several years worth of afternoons.</p>
        <p>I thoroughly read about the internal workings of Unity. I saw how many praised core systems that made The Forest a hit game were made and that knowledge actually retained because I modified them. I had to put my ingenuity to the test with implementing new systems, and solving technical problems to bypass the limitations of [<i>nonexistent</i>] modding kits. I had to struggle optimizing things for wider purposes that the base game did not intend. How to make UI that fits and works well. How to make mechanics subtly explained to the player. How to make something that is fun for many hours.</p>
        <p>This project was a multi-year deep dive into engine architecture and advanced gameplay programming. It taught me how to extend systems never intended for modification, build complex tools from scratch, and design gameplay loops that actually keep players engaged long-term.</p>

        <h2>The current state</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed the development process and I'm proud to show the results.</p>
        <p>Alas, all things good eventually come to an end.</p>
        <p>I stopped updating the mod and moved on to other games as the game received its final update with no new ones in sight, and Endnight Studio even released a sequel to The Forest. The mod remains one of the most downloaded and feature-rich mods for the original game.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, I return to add a new thing or two, or to improve something existing. Yet, every time I look at the code I wrote in the past and think to myself, that since then I improved leaps and bounds and can do xyz way better/cleaner. It makes me smile that there's visible improvements as a programmer due to pro experience and uni education.</p>
